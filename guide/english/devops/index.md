DevOps is the integration of work between Development and Operations functions. One approach in doing this is to automate how software is integrated and deployed as it migrates between development, testing, and production environments. This facilitates the installation processes for the software, thus ideally reducing the chance for error.

Alternatively, software development can be done within silos. One silo is responsible for taking feature requests, then turning them into software components with any programming language, and basic testing is done in an environment with fictious data. When the local testing is completed, the work products are handled off to a separate operations team that is responsible for then reinstalling the software into a separate production environment that supports real user traffic.  Once the software is in this environment, the operations teams maintain responsibility for the code, including identifying any product defects. If these defects are found, they are shared back with the development team, who attempts to resolve, then hands off a new version of software to the operations teams.

### Books

Get grounded on the basics of DevOps with a few of these well-received books that smartly break down the topic:

Designing Delivery: Rethinking IT in the Digital Service Economy: Jeff Sussna offers perspectives on making organizations customer-centric by revamping the product delivery lifecycle, a core DevOps value.

Leading the Transformation: Applying Agile and DevOps Principles at Scale: Gary Gruver and Tommy Mouser offer a CxO-level handbook for executives who want to take the reins in leading organizational transformation. How do you move from legacy thinking to a truly collaborative environment?

Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation: Jez Humble and David Farley’s 2011 text is a classic from the early days of DevOps, one that set out some of the core principles of integrated testing and improved collaboration between development and operations.

Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale: This is another book from Jez Humble, with Joanne Molesky and Barry O’Reilly, this time taking a fresh look at lean principles, with a focus on instilling these practices at every level of an organization, no matter how large and complex it is.

The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win: This really is a novel about DevOps, written by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford. If dry tech textbooks aren’t helping to win hearts and minds over to the DevOps camp, maybe this lively work of fiction comparing IT to a manufacturing plant will.

DevOps for Dummies: Claiming to take a business-centric approach to DevOps, this book by Sanjeev Sharma and Bernie Coyne of IBM is geared to executives but also valuable to practitioners who are new to DevOps and its relationship to the concerns of the front office.
